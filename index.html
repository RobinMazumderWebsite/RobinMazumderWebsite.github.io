								<h2>Hey there, my name is Arjun Kalburgi!</h2>
								<p>I'm a fun, growing, and learning developer out of the Canadian Prairies!
								I love to code, dance, eat, sleep, jam and of course learn!
								I'm currently based out of Edmonton, Alberta studying Computer Engineering
								at the University of Alberta. My dream is to use my knowledge of programming to 
								create software solutions that look beautiful and help people in their day-to-day lives.</p>

								<h3>My Interests</h3>
								<p>Many of my interests stem from my interests and hobbies 
									from childhood. Being enrolled in basketball programs, I 
									gained a strong love for the sport and the Boston Celtics. 
									At home, my mom kept the house colourful with music and dance 
									which it seems my personality is influenced by. Since high school,
									I also developed an interest in websites and mobile devices.</p>
							</section>
							<section>
								<h3>My Goals</h3>
								<p>At this point in my life my goals are really to finish my degree
									while learning as much as I possible can; that includes more
									about my own interests. I know that it's important to love what
									I do, so a huge goal for me is making sure I know what I love
									and then making sure I can do that; right now, that love seems to be 
									in web technologies.</p>
							</section>

								<h3>Enjoy!</h3>
								<p>Everything in this website is for you to get a better idea of who I am, so
								check out the other tabs for the type of work I've done before and links to other

									<hr>
									This Connect Four game was created for my CMPUT275 class at the University of Alberta. 
									The course is a mix of introductory computing courses, an algorithms course and the 
									introductory systems course. Thus the Objectives of the course are all over the place.<br /><br />

									In terms of algorithms, the objectives are to understand fundamental
									algorithm design. Thus includes searching, sorting and graphing algorithms like divide and conquer, 
									dynamic programming, and greedy methods. Using techniques to estimate such algorithm's efficiency is 
									also gone over. <br /><br />

									In terms of systems, the objectives of the course are to be able to use all the knowledge from 
									the rest of the course to design and implement non-trivial software solutions. These solutions 
									require good program design, the ability to use and create data structures, algorithms and application
									specific knowledge. <br /><br />

									The final objective is fairly theoretical in that it introduces the fundamental ideas of computing 
									- simply said, to gain a better understanding of computing and what software can help do. The course
									has a problem-driven approach with an emphasis on the underlying process behind the solution. <br /><br />
									
									We were restricted to using Python for the project (the language that the course is taught in) and my partner 
									and I had a desire to make a website. Our project was also required to have an "algorithmically challenging" 
									component to it and we ended up choosing Connect Four, where the algorithmically challenging component would 
									be the computers AI. <br />
									<hr>
									More about the project itself can be found on the README file of the project's GITHUB page
									It's fairly comprehensive, I apparently like to write essays for documentation.

									<hr>
									ShoutBox is still a work in progress. I started it with my friend at the annual
									24 hour long hackathon done by the University's Computer Engineering Club.<br/>
									ShoutBox is a Chrome Extension that allows users to Tweet directly from the Chrome
									Omnibox. The results were pretty awesome, we could Tweet on average 10-15 seconds
									faster through the Omnibox than by opening Twitter. And not to mention all the time
									that could be saved by not opening Twitter and getting distracted. <br/>
									After 24 hours we had a pretty good implementation of the application using a
									Node.js server running on my friends laptop. It was impressive enough to land us
									third in the competition! <br/>
									The app still needs some work, which I'm planning on doing in the summer. We ran into
									Twitter OAUTH issues because we tried to do the OAUTH dance from the Chrome Extension.
									I'm going to work on a website that communicates between Twitter and the extension
									to bypass the extension-OAUTH issues. <br/>
									Hopefully we can add more social networks like Facebook and Google+ as well!
									<hr>
									Because we did this at hackathon we didn't bother making a README file to go on the
									GITHUB page, but you can still go there to see the code (don't get your homes up though)
									I'll do everything properly once it's released.

									<hr>
									Arduino Tetris was created for my CMPUT274 class at the University of Alberta. The course itself is
									quite broad, dealing with objectives that form a strong all-round presense in computing. <br /><br />

									A large focus of the course dealt with programming Arduino's. Our assignments taught us to deal with 
									memory and hardware circuit issues while the weekly exercises focused on learning and using C++. <br /><br /> 

									We also went over some basic algorithms such as sorting and basic data structures like C's arrays 
									and linked lists.  <br /><br />

									The final objective is the same as it's sister course, CMPUT275, in that it introduces the 
									fundamental ideas of computing to gain a better understanding of computing 
									and what software can help do. The course has a problem-driven approach with an emphasis on the 
									underlying process behind the solution. <br /><br />

									We were restricted to using the Arduino for the project so my partner and I chose to 
									do something with the display, making our project more interactive.
									<hr>
									More about the project itself can be found on the README file of the project's GITHUB page
									There you'll see that the challenge of this project was really in the design of the
									Arduino display, not the implementation.

									<hr>
									I built a mobile Confrenece app while I worked for
									<a style="color: white;" target="_blank" href="http://www.fourthdimensioninc.com/">fourthdimension inc.</a>
									as an intern.
									The mobile webapp was created using the
									<a style="color: white;" target="_blank" href="http://www.fourthdimensioninc.com/">Ionic Framework</a>
									and
									<a style="color: white;" target="_blank" href="http://www.fourthdimensioninc.com/">Apache Cordova.</a>
									The app was built to provide attendees with the conference schedule, details on the seminars and presenters,
									maps of the area and provided internal staff with user feedback on seminars.<br/><br/>

									The application handled all this data this with read and
									write capabilities to an Azure Mobile Service; numerous backend JavaScript services had to be
									created in order to manipulate the data for the app's use.
									I worked with coworkers to create the user interface of the application, which was built with SCSS and CSS.<br/><br/>

									To debug the program, I created a spreadsheet to keep track of all the issues. I set up use-case scenarios
									to make sure the application would work properly, or give the users helpful hints as to what is
									going wrong. The scenarios came in handy when testing offline functionality, because sitting in the office
									I was always online and I would have forgotten to test it.
									Since the application would be ported to both Android and iOS, debugging required using web
									development tools for Chrome and Safari and remote debugging for Android and iOS.<br/><br/>

									I also wrote the documentation for the application, which required me to go over each step of the code and
									explain it in full detail; written in it were descriptions about the app’s repository, testing
									the app, the plugins and libraries used, as well as a walkthrough of the code.
									<hr>
									The project required me to learn and deal with Angular.js framework, Ionic framework, Command Line, GIT, CSS
									some JavaScript and Azure Databases. As well as taught me lessons about working with a team in an office environment.
									Unfortunately, since the application was created under contract, I do not have access to point you to any of the work I did.

									Runner Runner was created for the ENCMP100 programming contest. ENCMP 100 is a first-year engineering course that teaches
									students introductory programming using MATLAB. All engineering students at the Unuversity of Alberta are required to take 
									the course in first year. The contest is funded from MathWorks (the creators of MATLAB) and is optional. All submissions must 
									have an original MATLAB program and an accompanying video presentation and we were allowed to work with teams of at most two. <br/><br/>

									The project was really my first project ever, Nick did most of the coding and I did all the graphics and the video. 
									It was a really good learning experience despite the fact that I didn't code much. Here is the video we submitted.<br/><br/>

									Creating this website is also a project! This is the first ever responsive website I've
									created and my first real standalone battle with CSS; boy was it a challenge! After
									a long fight with trying to hack the CSS into making it look good, I finally went in
									did everything properly. The style could be better but it's not the mess it was!
									You can see the code for the site on the GITHUB page (hopefully I'll update that with the site).
									One really awesome thing about the website is how the back-end is set up. The website has a Github
									repository on the Github server; my local repository for the website
									is stored in Google Drive, so that it is synced across all my computers. The same directory is
									what I use to host the repository! So a project which normally would need to be stored in four places
									(local repository for my two computers, Github repository and hosting service) is just stored in
									two!
									<br />
									<br />
									The website was a fresh coding experience after all the drag code-work of my classes.
									Got to learn some good CSS tricks, as well as the trick to host the website via Google Drive
