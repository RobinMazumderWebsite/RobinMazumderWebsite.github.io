							Only by speaking and conversing to and with first year engineering students at the University of Alberta, can you understand how terrible the perspective of Computer Engineering is for these students. A big part of that is ENCMP 100, a course that all first year engineers take that teaches MATLAB. ENCMP teaches students code and syntax, and not problem solving or any other skill Computer Engineers use.<br>
							The lack of understanding gets me heated. <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/brittany-lamorie-37941193">Brittany</a> and I are working with <a href="http://www.ece.ualberta.ca/~fair/">Ivan Fair</a> to make the course better. I hope to introduce focus on problem solving, resourcefulness and debugging as soft skills. I believe that people that are taught how to code by focusing on what can be created from the skill is a really good way to grow passion in the subject, let's see if it's possible :D

						<p class="text">
							HackTime is a project I've been interested in doing for slightly less than a year since beginning it. The concept is to bring together coders more consistently than hackathons allow for. With the goal is to encourage students to work on side projects, simply booking a room and coding together can create a safe space and community for these students.<br>
							When the new VP Social for CompE Club had a similar idea, I jumped on it. Unfortunately, the project is taking longer to get off the ground than most of my projects. I don't want to be too involved to give more time to other projects, and others seem to be too busy. Hopefully it'll get going next year :D

							HackEd 2017<br>
							Making events bigger and better might be more difficult than doing them the first time. This year I'm no longer an executive member of CompE Club, but I was still one of the main organizers of HackEd. This year we sported more hackers, more sponsors, more mentors, more judges and we still accomplished the goal of inspiring and growing passion. It reminds me why I do it all, and gets me going for HackEd 2018 (which I started a week after HackEd 2017). We had more outreach this year too, which means next year we will grow again :D Check out links to the left, they will depreciate for 2018's events eventually, but check them out!<br><br>
							ECE Week 2017 <br>
							ECE Week did not go so well this year, improvements made from last year flopped and we lost strong members from our organising team that transition docs did not help to make up for. I don't think I'll be involved here next year. It's difficult to find motivation for an event that students don't like.

						<p class="text">
							I was disappointed in courses I could take for electives, but I heard from a friend that Computer Engineers at the University of Alberta could take electives online through Athabasca University. Out of all the courses approved for credits by the Director of Computer Engineering, only one of them stuck out. Unfortunately it was no longer offered by AU. I looked through AU courses offered for good ones I'd like to take and  decided to approach the Director about them. Understanding that I brought him courses the University did not offer already, he approved them for me and added them to the list of approved courses from AU. <br/><br/>
							Since getting those courses approved, I've learned that a lot of my peers are joining me in taking them. :D I was able to expand the scope of my degree for myself and for others.

							Once former president, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/brittany-lamorie-37941193">Brittany Lamorie</a> and I found that being executive members of the club and trying to create new opportunities for CompE's was very difficult, we decided that we would not be a part of CompE Club and instead work on events like these. <a href="http://blog.arjunkalburgi.com/post/146902178771/my-new-mission" target="_blank">Read my emotionally charged blog post on it here</a>, but essentially How to CompE is a series of 4 workshops (Networking, Job Search, Resume and Interview) to help CompE's be better prepared navigating the industry. <br>
							The events went really well, but unfortunately the timing was bad and turnout was underwhelming. We're taking steps to fix this to bring the good teachings to more students. <br> <br>

							As VP External for the Computer Engineering (CompE) Club, my task was to organize and run ECE Week and our Hackathon, HackEd. This requred creating websites, creating a professional sponsorship package, contacting over 100 different companies, interacting with industry professionals, and MC-ing the hackathon's opening ceremonies. Contacting companies was ecspecially challenging as I led all the CompE Club members to help me. I wrote an email outline and listed companies for members to find contact info for and contact. Overall ECE Week and the Hackathon were successful events!
