						Hard at work again for ECE Week and HackEd 2017, though no longer as an executive. I'm working with the new members of team-x (name coined by me for the External team of the CompE Club) to put on a great event this year. See the events here (these links will depreciate for 2018's events) <a href="https://eceweek.compeclub.com">ECE Week website</a> and <a href="https://hacked.compeclub.com">HackEd website</a>

						Once former president, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/brittany-lamorie-37941193">Brittany Lamorie</a> and I found that being executive members of the club and trying to create new opportunities for CompE's was very difficult, we decided that we would not be a part of CompE Club and instead work on events like these. <a href="http://blog.arjunkalburgi.com/post/146902178771/my-new-mission" target="_blank">Read my emotionally charged blog post on it here</a>, but essentially How to CompE is a series of 4 workshops (Networking, Job Search, Resume and Interview) to help CompE's be better prepared navigating the industry. <br>
						The events went really well, but unfortunately the timing was bad and turnout was underwhelming. We're taking steps to fix this to bring the good teachings to more students. <br> <br>

						As VP External for the Computer Engineering (CompE) Club, my task was to organize and run ECE Week and our Hackathon, HackEd. This requred creating websites, creating a professional sponsorship package, contacting over 100 different companies, interacting with industry professionals, and MC-ing the hackathon's opening ceremonies. Contacting companies was ecspecially challenging as I led all the CompE Club members to help me. I wrote an email outline and listed companies for members to find contact info for and contact. Overall ECE Week and the Hackathon were successful events!
