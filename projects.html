								In an effort to modernize my Javascript, I've been working with my friend and mentor <a href="http://www.afontaine.ca/about/">Andrew Fontaine</a> to learn it. Approximately once a week we hop on a Google Hangouts video call and he works me through something new. We have/plan to cover ES2016, React, TypeScript, Redux and more. Stay tuned for more work here :)

								Wanting to use reveal.js for a presentation deck, I realized that reveal.js doesn't have a lot of default themes - and then that reveal.js doesn't have a lot of themes online at all! So I made a library and themer, makeoverðŸ’„, a one stop shop to "reveal" a "makeover". Hopefully I'll get a few friends to contribute during Digital Ocean's Hacktoberfest and makeoverðŸ’„   will be the biggest reveal.js theme library online!

My group ended up choosing <a href="#dbhospitalapp">my first database project</a> which was unfortunate as a blow to my morale, but fortunate as a opportunity to self-test my own projects. Self-testing and CI is something I should begin implementing on some projects in the future.

								A project for my introductory database class, CMPUT 291. I worked with <a href="https://github.com/Megasonic988">Kevin Wang</a> and we decided that he would do the backend API, and I would do the front end use cases. This unfortunately let to quite a few issues during the demo due to lack of testing, but I was proud of our structure and abstraction (though there could have been more). This is the first project where I just naturally gravitated to this level of abstraction and I really enjoyed it! I feel like, with more practice, I would enjoy orchestrating software system design.

								Cloudy Car is a group project done for my CMPUT 301 class. I had a lot less Android experience and experience in general than my group members. I unfortunately took a backseat for this project - which was difficult to accept, although I tried my best to contribute as much as I could. I did most of the design and almost all of the layouts of the app, using Figma (online version of Sketch) and xml. It was really fun to do and is prompted me to start an Android design library like Bootstrap or Materialize!

								Together with a few other members of the Computer Engineering Club, I worked to update the club's WordPress site. The site is hard-coded in PHP and I did much of the design and CSS work. In related work, I helped design the new club logo and paved the way for the era of the circuit theme. In the past, CompE needed a fresh and modern design and this is the year we finally delivered!

								Needing to get back into coding during a lax summer, I decided to help a friend out and build her a website for her brand. I really like using Tumblr for websites that need to post updates because I can easily hard-code a lot of the design elements, whereas in WordPress or Weebly much is left to the templates.

								The University of Alberta has a program for students called the "Dean's Research Award", upon signing up for the the program, the student conducts some type of research with the help/guidance of a professor that agrees. Dr. Reformat, from my RDF work in the summer, agreed to work with me on a new project that would continue on the work from the summer - an RDF Crawler.<br /><br />The Crawler crawls the DBpedia database for RDF tripes containing the properties that you specify and outputs the result into a file. A presentation was required in order to complete and receive the award. <br /><br />Both code for the Crawler, and the presentation are linked on the card.

								For my second HackED hackathon, I tried to go bigger than ever. Knowing that hardware hacks that are rooted in reality usually do win hackathons, I assembled a team that would be able to design and build an arcade game with an element of gamifying education. As a team we came up with the idea that a puzzle game where the user places fire safety items where the AI people can find them to save themselves when the fire starts until the fire truck can get there to save them. <br /><br />The game was built with SDL C++, which is much more low level than I'm used to. I was tasked with the UI of the game and had a lot of work trying to create something that looked nice with a minimum amount of tools.<br /><br />Fire Escape was made to be an arcade game and an arcade box and hardware controls were built for it for the hackathon. However the software was buggy and our presentation did not appeal to the judges so we didn't place.

								Ciao is an app that allows you to better utilize the world around you by helping you turn the strangers nearby into acquaintances for your needs. Ciao is very well explained in the Devpost.<br /><br />Ciao was originally built during Hack the North, an international hackathon in Waterloo, ON. The Ciao that came out of the hackathon is an Ionic App and uses Facebook and Firebase to get and keep data. This method is less than ideal and I hope to work on Ciao more someday once I learn Android Development. Ciao can be produced much better as a native application, unfortunately my partner and I didn't have enough knowledge at the time to go this route during the competition.

								Over the summer of 2015, I worked for <a href="https://www.ualberta.ca/~reformat/">Dr. Marek Reformat</a> testing a new library for his RDF research. Dr. Reformat would gave me simple tasks weekly or biweekly that would test the aspects of the library he needed. In this way, I slowly learned Java basics and a lot about RDF data and using data! <br /><br />RDF stands for Resource Description Framework - a model for describing data on the Web. A RDF triple is a unit of RDF data - it's called a triple because its form consists of three parts: a subject, a property and an object. Each triple individually describes the subjects relationship with the object and with an entire set of triples, you can create a graph (the subject and object are nodes, property is an edge) and therefore describe the relationship among many subjects/objects!

								The idea behind this project comes from the realization I had that people's opinions are the best form of qualitative data for many things in our world. Applications like Rotten Tomatoes and Yelp have become very popular offering this simple service to a topic of need (movies and restaurants respectively). This project is my attempt to create such an application for a now unknown/undecided topic of need. <br /><br />The template uses ASP.NET's MVC framework and Entity Framework. I used .NET's scaffolding to quickly create the front end and used Bootstrap for some looks. Entity Framework took care of all the object-relational mapping - what data goes where and is related to other data how. I based this project on a tutorial from ASP.NET's website, it can be found <a href="https://www.asp.net/mvc/overview/getting-started/getting-started-with-ef-using-mvc">here</a>.

								I learned about Django's MVC power when working on the ConnectFour app. Django supports MVC much more extensively than Flask does, making me want to try it - I explain this <a href="https://github.com/askalburgi/SentimentAnalysis_DjangoApp/blob/master/nlpapp/templates/mvc.html">here</a>.<br /><br /> At Google I/O 2015, Google announced Now on Tap. As you can imagine, that product got me very excited about Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Machine Learning (ML). NLP is the process computer's use to understand language and heavily uses ML to work. Sentiment Analysis is an area of NLP which determines whether the language has a positive or negative connotation. I've written more about the app's NLP function <a href="https://github.com/askalburgi/SentimentAnalysis_DjangoApp/blob/master/nlpapp/templates/nlp.html">here</a>.

								I built a mobile Confrenece app while I worked for <a target="_blank" href="http://www.fourthdimensioninc.com/">fourthdimension inc.</a> as an intern. The mobile webapp was created using the <a target="_blank" href="http://www.fourthdimensioninc.com/">Ionic Framework</a> and <a target="_blank" href="http://www.fourthdimensioninc.com/">Apache Cordova.</a> The app was built to provide attendees with the conference schedule, details on the seminars and presenters, maps of the area and provided internal staff with user feedback on seminars and to be a template for future years.<br/><br/>The application handled all this data with read and write capabilities to an Azure Mobile Service and some JavaScript services. I worked with coworkers to create the user interface of the application, which was built with SCSS and CSS.<br/><br/> The project required me to learn and deal with Angular.js framework, Ionic framework, Command Line, GIT, CSS some JavaScript and Azure Databases. It taught me lessons about working with a team in an office environment. Unfortunately, since the application was created under contract, I do not have access to point you to any of the work I did.

								Runner Runner was created for the ENCMP100 programming contest funded by MathWorks. The project was really my first project ever, Nick did most of the coding and I did all the graphics and the video. It was a really good learning experience despite the fact that I didn't code much. YouTube link above is the video we submitted.<br/>Nick and I placed 2nd in the competition! You can see the code on github <i style="display: inline;" class="small fa fa-github-square"></i>.
