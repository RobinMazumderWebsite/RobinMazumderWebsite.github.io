Hopefully I'll get a few friends to contribute during Digital Ocean's Hacktoberfest and makeoverðŸ’„   will be the biggest reveal.js theme library online!</p></span>

This unfortunately let to quite a few issues during the demo due to lack of testing, but I was proud of our structure and abstraction (though there could have been more). This is the first project where I just naturally gravitated to this level of abstraction and I really enjoyed it! I feel like, with more practice, I would enjoy orcastrating software system design.</p></span>

I unfortunately took a backseat for this project - which was difficult to accept, although I tried my best to contribute as much as I could. I did most of the design and almost all of the layouts of the app, using Figma (online version of Sketch) and xml. It was really fun to do and is prompted me to start an Andoird design library like Bootstrap or Materialize!</p></span>

					<span class="text" style="display:none;"><p>For my second HackED hackathon, I tried to go bigger than ever. Knowing that hardware hacks that are rooted in reality usually do win hackathons, I assembled a team that would be able to design and build an arcade game with an element of gamifying education. As a team we came up with the idea that a puzzle game where the user places fire safety items where the AI people can find them to save themselves when the fire starts until the fire truck can get there to save them. 
					<br /><br />
					The game was built with SDL C++, which is much more low level than I'm used to. I was tasked with the UI of the game and had a lot of work trying to create something that looked nice with a minimum amount of tools. 
					<br /><br />
					Fire Escape was made to be an arcade game and an arcade box and hardware controls were built for it for the hackathon. However the software was buggy and our presentation did not appeal to the judges so we didn't place. Fire Escape still has to be worked on, and the team and I plan on working on it throughout Summer '16. </p></span>

This requred creating websites, creating a professional sponsorship package, contacting over 100 different companies, interacting with industry professionals, and MC-ing the hackathon's opening ceremonies. Contacting companies was ecspecially challenging as I led all the CompE Club members to help me. I wrote an email outline and listed companies for members to find contact info for and contact.

					<br /><br />
					Ciao was originally built during Hack the North, an international hackathon in Waterloo, ON. The Ciao that came out of the hackathon is an Ionic App and uses Facebook and Firebase to get and keep data. This method is less than ideal and I hope to work on Ciao more someday once I learn Android Development. Ciao can be produced much better as a native application, unfortunately my partner and I didn't have enough knowledge at the time to go this route during the competition.</p></span>

					<span class="text" style="display:none;"><p>Over the summer of 2015, I worked for <a href="https://www.ualberta.ca/~reformat/">Dr. Marek Reformat</a> testing a new library for his RDF research. Dr. Reformat would gave me simple tasks weekly or biweekly that would test the aspects of the library he needed. In this way, I slowly learned Java basics and a lot about RDF data and using data! 
					<br /><br />
					RDF stands for Resource Description Framework - a model for describing data on the Web. A RDF triple is a unit of RDF data - it's called a triple because its form consists of three parts: a subject, a property and an object. Each triple individually describes the subjects relationship with the object and with an entire set of triples, you can create a graph (the subject and object are nodes, property is an edge) and therefore describe the relationship among many subjects/objects!</p></span>

					<span class="text" style="display:none;"><p>The idea behind this project comes from the realization I had that people's opinions are 
					the best form of qualitative data for many things in our world. Applications like Rotten 
					Tomatoes and Yelp have become very popular offering this simple service to a topic of need (movies and restaurants respectively). This project is my attempt to create such an application for a now unknown/undecided topic of need. 
					<br /><br />
					The template uses ASP.NET's MVC framework and Entity Framework. I used .NET's scaffolding to quickly create the front end and used Bootstrap for some looks. Entity Framework took care of all the object-relational mapping - what data goes where and is related to other data how. I based this project on a tutorial from ASP.NET's website, it can be found <a href="https://www.asp.net/mvc/overview/getting-started/getting-started-with-ef-using-mvc">here</a>. </p></span>

					At Google I/O 2015, Google announced Now on Tap. As you can imagine, that product got me very excited about Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Machine Learning (ML). NLP is the process computer's use to understand language and heavily uses ML to work. Sentiment Analysis is an area of NLP which determines whether the language has a positive or negative connotation. I've written more about the app's NLP function <a href="https://github.com/askalburgi/SentimentAnalysis_DjangoApp/blob/master/nlpapp/templates/nlp.html">here</a>.</p></span>

					<span class="text" style="display:none;"><p>This Connect Four game was created for my CMPUT275 class at the University of Alberta. 
					The course is a mix of introductory computing courses, an algorithms course and the 
					introductory systems course and is taught in Python. 
					<br /><br />
					My partner and I had a desire to make a website for our class project. Our project was also required to have an "algorithmically challenging" component. ConnectFour's algorithmically challenging component is it's AI which is able to play against the user. There is a lot more information on the <i class="small fa fa-github-square"></i>!</p></span>

					My friend and I began working on it for the UofA Computer Engineering Club's annual hackathon in the Winter of 2015. We won third place at the hackathon but at that time the app was far from a finished product. After the school term ended we went back and completed it with a a lot of polishing and a Node server/website which takes care of the Twitter side of the application.</p></span>

					<span class="text" style="display:none;"><p>Arduino Tetris was created for my CMPUT274 class at the University of Alberta. The course itself is quite broad, dealing with objectives that form strong all-round fundamentals of computing. 
					</br></br>
					We were restricted to using the Arduino for the project so my partner and I chose to 
					do something with the display, making our project more interactive.</p></span>

					<span class="text" style="display:none;"><p>I built a mobile Confrenece app while I worked for <a target="_blank" href="http://www.fourthdimensioninc.com/">fourthdimension inc.</a> as an intern. The mobile webapp was created using the <a target="_blank" href="http://www.fourthdimensioninc.com/">Ionic Framework</a> and <a target="_blank" href="http://www.fourthdimensioninc.com/">Apache Cordova.</a> The app was built to provide attendees with the conference schedule, details on the seminars and presenters, maps of the area and provided internal staff with user feedback on seminars and to be a template for future years.
					<br/><br/>
					The application handled all this data with read and write capabilities to an Azure Mobile Service and some JavaScript services. I worked with coworkers to create the user interface of the application, which was built with SCSS and CSS.
					<br/><br/>
					The project required me to learn and deal with Angular.js framework, Ionic framework, Command Line, GIT, CSS some JavaScript and Azure Databases. It taught me lessons about working with a team in an office environment. Unfortunately, since the application was created under contract, I do not have access to point you to any of the work I did.</p></span>

					<span class="text" style="display:none;"><p>Runner Runner was created for the ENCMP100 programming contest funded by MathWorks. The project was really my first project ever, Nick did most of the coding and I did all the graphics and the video. It was a really good learning experience despite the fact that I didn't code much. YouTube link above is the video we submitted.
					<br/>
					Nick and I placed 2nd in the competition! You can see the code on github <i style="display: inline;" class="small fa fa-github-square"></i>.</p></span>
