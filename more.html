					This hackathon was hosted by Ualberta's Computer Engineering Club at a local company 
					(<a href="http://startupedmonton.com/">Startup Edmonton</a>). 
					The hackathon is a 24-hour coding competition done annually and for students only, 
					to find out more you can go to the club's website <a href="http://www.compeclub.com/hacked-2015/">here</a>.
					<br /><br />

					At this hackathon, I teamed up with my friend <a href="https://www.ualberta.ca/~hsingh3/">Harpreet</a>
					to start what eventually turned into ShoutBox. You can read more about ShoutBox as a 
					project in the <a href="/projects.html">Project section</a>. <br /><br />

					Harpreet and I had a great presentation at the end of the 24 hours and got third place among all 
					participating teams! The judges loved our product, and the marketability of "ShoutBox". I think 
					it helped that we presented last and gave the room a jolt of energy by literally shouting our 
					presentation; our project was called ShoutBox after all ;) <br /><br />

					Here are some pictures I took at the event! <br />

					At Computer Engineering (CompE) Club's Fall AGM, I was elected Second-Year Rep! The year reps make up members of

					the umbrella of the Club's VP Internal. This is because the Second-Year rep is usually one of the youngest

					As my younger sister and I grow as kids, there is less and less opportunity to visit the mother
					country. This trip was well timed for two reasons, (1) I had just finished my high school education
					and (2) I hadn't been to India 6 years prior and I probably won't go again in another 6 years. 
					I'm born and raised in Canada and am very much Canadian, so though I understand the culture well
					and the language a little bit, India is still very foreign to me. Because of this, my trips to India 
					always end up being very educational - there always seems to be something to learn. <br/><br/>

					On this trip I had to learn vulnerability. I really don't have much independence in India; the locals 
					can quickly sniff out foreigners and manipulate them for their own gain. If that sounds scary that's 
					because it was supposed to. That's how I feel when I walk through the streets. <br/><br/>

					Overall though, I remember I had a lot of enjoyable moments on the trip. I visited New Delhi, Jaipur 
					and Agra for the first time - and it was totally wicked. Also a lot of my close cousins were able to 
					visit at the same time so I enjoyed spending time with them. Here are some pictures: <br/>

					Business Celebration Night is an event held by the Business Club where business folks from around the

					categories to celebrate their individual and group achievements in business from that school year. The event
					is has a photo booth, refreshments, musical entertainment and speeches.<br/><br/>

					As both President and VP Events of the Business Club (read more about the Business Club below), 
					Business Celebration Night was a very important night for me in both years that I was with the Club.
					The two Nights I was involved happened to be the first and second time something like this was
					ever done, so decisions had to be made on the theme, style of the invitations and program cards, 
					type of refreshments, decoration of the school, and many other things. 

					The month leading up to the night was very hectic and delegating duties became a large part of the event for 
					me. That being said, the actual Celebration Nights themselves were very fun, here are some pictures:

					Mosaic is a festival held throughout the city of Regina organised by the 
					<a href="http://www.reginamulticulturalcouncil.ca/">Regina Multicultural Council</a> (RMC) and
					celebrates the cultures of the city. Each cultural group has a pavilion where they show off
					entertainment, food and things of cultural significance. My family and I have been part of the
					Indian pavilion during Mosaic for many years, usually contributing as volunteers and entertainment. 
					(My dance videos are below) In my final two years in Regina, I joined the 
					<a href="http://indiacanadasask.ca/">India-Canada Association</a> (ICA) as the Youth Ambassador, whose
					main job is to organise the entertainment at the varies events the ICA hosts - naturally Mosiac is 
					one of the larger ones. As Youth Ambassador, I automatically take a seat on the RMC as one of the many
					Mosaic Youth Representatives whose main responsibility is to help publicise Mosaic as a whole. <br/><br/>

					Being Youth Ambassador was a very maddening experience. Everyone else, as adults, think they can do
					your job better than you, so the job became just as much dealing with egos and people as creating 
					an entertainment schedule and MCing. But like Celebration Night, the end of each day at Mosaic are a 
					lot more enjoyable, probably because I was on stage.

					From as far back as I can remember I've been in Indian/Bollywood/Bhangra dance groups. Just a bunch of 
					friends mainly performing at the aforementioned Mosaic as kids, as we grew older we began to perform at 
					weddings, cultural events, and  even business events. Our dances went from being chroreographed by our 
					parents to ourselves, from cute dances to legitimate performances. I can firmly say I'm proud to be a part
					of this crew, and dancing with all our might.<br /><br />
					Some of our performances are on YouTube, and you can see them here:

					In my Grade 11 year, one of my favourite teachers launched the Business Club, an
					extra-ciricular extension of the school's business program. I was elected VP Events 
					that year and, along with the other executive members, went on to build the club
					as something that can last year to year. With the teacher-advisor's business contacts
					we were invited to a lot of business events from around the provice, one of which
					was the first annual Saskatchewn High School Business Case Competition. I was
					one of the members of the team from my school and together we brought home the "
					Business School of the Year" award!<br/><br/>

					The next year I assumed the mantle of President, where my job was to oversee and 
					organise the club's week-to-week activity. This meant arranging and moderating the 
					club’s weekly meetings, which included consulting with teacher advisors and planning and 
					discussing ventures for the club. In a larger venture to try and make the Club more
					fluid from year to year, I wrote six “Department Packages” for each department of the club. These were to help establish roles and responsibilities of all members of the club
					so that each year when students graduated, there would be documentation for other 
					students to replace them.<br/><br/>

					Naturally, Business Club's Celebration Night was also a large part of my duties 
					in both years, more about that is above. In my final year, I was awarded "Business
					Student of the Year" for all my efforts to build up the club. Looking back I truely 
					enjoyed my time with the club and I'm really glad I could be such a big part of it.
